# Hello World!
**I'm @CuWilliams, A GitHub Newbie** 
- I’m a retired engineer who has spent his career in industrial and construction management
- Now, I'm spending time learning about HTML and CSS, among other things ...
- I’m interested in developing a web page for a Rock Band which also occupies some of my time in retirement!
- Let the journey begin
- Cheers!
